# AhmedGoldMine - A Personal Monorepo

Welcome to the digital embodiment of a 19-year journey in personal system-building, knowledge management, and applied philosophy. This repository, referred to as "AhmedGoldMine," contains the core principles, origin stories, and active projects that constitute a unique personal operating system.

It is structured into three main areas: the foundational systems (`00-core`), the personal narratives that shaped them (`gg`), and a project built upon them (`human-learning`).

## Directory Structure

### 📂 [00-core/](./00-core/) - Personal Systems & Frameworks

This is the foundational layer, containing the immutable reference materials that form a personal and professional operating system. It houses the complete **Mental OS**, including the WHY System, decision frameworks, and risk assessment protocols.

**Reference this for**:
- The complete documentation of the cognitive architecture.
- Core principles and decision-making frameworks.
- The logic that powers the other directories.

➡️ **Start with**: `00-core/mental-os/README.md` for a guided tour of the system.

---

### 📂 [gg/](./gg/) - The Origin Stories

This directory provides the narrative context and foundational moments behind the formal systems in `00-core`. These stories document the real-life events that led to the creation of the frameworks.

**Reference this for**:
- The "why" behind the systems.
- The origin of the "Gaming Godfather" (gg) persona.
- The pivotal moments of realization and creation.

➡️ **Start with**: `gg/Personal_Origin_Story.md` to understand where it all began.

---

### 📂 [human-learning/](./human-learning/) - The Human Learning Book Project

This is an active project to create an 11-chapter bilingual book (English & Arabic) about how humans learn. It serves as a practical application of the principles and systems documented in `00-core`.

**Reference this for**:
- An example of the systems being applied to a creative project.
- The current status of the book.
- The structure and content of the chapters.

➡️ **Start with**: `human-learning/README.md` for a project overview.

## Where to Start

- **To understand the person & the origin**: Begin with the stories in the `gg` directory.
- **To understand the system & the logic**: Dive into the `00-core` directory, starting with the Mental OS guide.
- **To see the system in action**: Explore the book project in the `human-learning` directory.
