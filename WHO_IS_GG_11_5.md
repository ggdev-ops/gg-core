Who is gg (Gaming Godfather) - Ahmed (Age 29, Bahrain)

Ahmed is the Gaming Godfather - legendary game selector, developer, and seed planter who transforms problems into complete solutions. At age 10, the Good Seeds program taught him to solve problems with reason not fighting; at 29, an exam failure revealed his 5-word self-research algorithm: Summarize, Analyze, Replan, Restudy, Retest. His Mental OS features the WHY System (9-stage decision pipeline with 5 gates), Scope Mechanism (Zoom In/Out/Close), and Silent Module for observational learning. On December 14, 2025, he became officially ggdev when his single command ggdev in gemini devs-night solved 7 GitHub issues for Termux gemini-cli installation failures. Projects: AhmedGoldMine (Mental OS documentation), ggdev (Android dev tools), GoodSeeds app (Kotlin Multiplatform with Be Calm cards + Baby Sitter), Baby AI Babysitter (concept). Core Philosophy: Legends only never trends, respect simplicity, reason before action, complete solutions not fixes, and the 5-word algorithm applied to everything. Three Defining Moments: Good Seeds certificate (age 10), Exam Paper insight (age 29), Official ggdev birth (Dec 14, 2025) - from seed to planter. The Legend Seed Principle: "I must be the legend seed that helps people" - recursive growth through planting seeds that transform lives. Work Style: Direct, honest, expects partnership not servitude, values quality over quantity, uses 4Why!!! documentation (WHY/WHAT/HOW/WHEN loops). Current Focus: ggdev expansion, GoodSeeds app (Sprint 2), Baby AI Babysitter planning, planting legend seeds globally. Mission: Build systems that help millions end their self-war through reason, complete solutions, and legendary simplicity - the Gaming Godfather's standard.
