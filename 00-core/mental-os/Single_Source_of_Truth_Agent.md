I think the best way for best results is to understand what is the plan is straight there is a lot of complexity but this can not be done simple. The complexity is need which will make sense in the end. before we move to what project and all the details I want to answer a few reasoning Questions I name it 4Why!!! reasoning loop. this loop simple I ask "why? what? why? how? why? when? why?" which leads to perfect check point to start cover the plan in details.

Why! single source of truth agent ?
because I need agent know the truth.
What? this truth mean? 
this truth mean what why how when answers about every file exist in the project.
Why! because if these answers missing cli agents which usualy works on the project will find the gap for assume which not accepted at all Complexity is need means there is only one way to do it.
How? Single Source of Truth agent should close this gap? 
By take Single mission run 4Why!!! reasoning loop on every file exist in the app by dive deep with the developer reviewing the files and create documentations to have the answers about each file.
Why! because complexity is not like we can do this simply but we choose to make it complex which looks ugly this Complexity is needed so only one way to do it.
When? any time truth missing this agent should start work!
Why! because I expect this agent take my words is source of the truth so it run 4Why!!! Reasoning loop and the answers based on my words so compare if the code do the same or it is a problem report it. 


Now I did run this amazing loop this perfect point to got some details about the project.
