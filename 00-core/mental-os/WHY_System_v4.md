# WHY System v4: Compressed Reasoning System

**Status:** Active Development
**Evolution:** V3 (7 gates) → V4 (3 rules)
**Purpose:** Same protection, less overhead, faster processing

## Pipeline Overview

```
┌──────────┐
│ PURPOSE  │ → Relevance / WHY
└─────┬────┘
      ↓
┌──────────┐
│ CONTEXT  │ → WHEN + WHERE fused
└─────┬────┘
      ↓
┌──────────┐
│EXECUTION │ → WHAT + HOW combined
└──────────┘
```

## The Three Rules

### Rule 1: PURPOSE / INTENT

**Gatekeeper:** All actions start here

**Checks:**
- Relevance
- Necessity
- Motivation

**Effect:** Eliminates noise before wasting cognitive energy

---

### Rule 2: CONTEXT / CIRCUMSTANCE

**Combines:** WHEN + WHERE from V3

**Checks:**
- Timing
- Environment
- Situation alignment

**Effect:** Only allows actions that are feasible here and now

---

### Rule 3: EXECUTION / METHOD

**Combines:** WHAT + HOW from V3

**Checks:**
- Action validity
- Efficiency
- Correctness

**Effect:** Ensures output is optimal and aligned with PURPOSE & CONTEXT

---

## Why This Works

**Protection Preserved:**
Every check in V3 still exists, just fused logically

**Less Overhead:**
Brain runs 3 axioms instead of 7 sequential gates

**Faster Processing:**
Evaluates actions as high-level rules rather than step-by-step

**Mental OS Kernel Update:**
V4 is the axiomatic version of V3

## V3 → V4 Compression Map

| V3 Gate / Node | Function | Mapped to V4 Rule |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| WHY (initial)  | Relevance filter                 | PURPOSE / INTENT         |
| WHEN           | Timing check                     | CONTEXT / CIRCUMSTANCE   |
| WHY (after WHEN) | Re-evaluate relevance after timing | CONTEXT / CIRCUMSTANCE   |
| WHERE          | Environment / situational check  | CONTEXT / CIRCUMSTANCE   |
| WHY (after WHERE)| Re-evaluate relevance after context| CONTEXT / CIRCUMSTANCE   |
| WHAT (if)      | Action candidate generation      | EXECUTION / METHOD       |
| WHY (after WHAT) | Action value check               | EXECUTION / METHOD       |
| HOW (then)     | Method / procedure for action    | EXECUTION / METHOD       |
| WHY (final)    | Final gate for execution validity| EXECUTION / METHOD       |

## Visual Comparison

### V3 (5 Gates + 4 Nodes)
```
WHY → WHEN → WHY → WHERE → WHY → WHAT → WHY → HOW → WHY
```

### V4 (3 Rules / Axioms)
```
PURPOSE → CONTEXT → EXECUTION
```

---

## Key Points

### PURPOSE / INTENT
- Covers the initial WHY gate
- Filters all irrelevant signals immediately

### CONTEXT / CIRCUMSTANCE
- Combines WHEN, WHERE, and intermediate WHY checks
- Ensures timing and environment are correct before deciding the action

### EXECUTION / METHOD
- Combines WHAT, HOW, and final WHY gate
- Validates that the action is correct, feasible, and efficient

---

## Summary

- **Every V3 check exists in V4** - just fused
- **Same protection** - no security lost
- **Less mental overhead** - simpler mental model
- **Faster reasoning** - axioms instead of sequential gates

This is the compressed, optimized version of the WHY System for high-speed decision-making.

**Created:** Based on V3 framework
**Status:** V4 compression complete
