# WHY System v4: Compressed Reasoning System

**Status:** Active Development
**Evolution:** V3 (Non-Linear "4+Why" Model) → V4 (3-Phase Compression)
**Purpose:** To provide a high-speed axiomatic version of the V3 reasoning loop.

---

## Pipeline Overview

The new V4 compresses the V3 model into three distinct, sequential phases:

```
┌─────────────┐
│ EXPLORATION │ → What, When, Where, Why
└──────┬──────┘
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│ VALIDATION  │ → The Why? Gatekeeper
└──────┬──────┘
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  EXECUTION  │ → How
└─────────────┘
```

## The Three Rules

### Rule 1: EXPLORATION / DISCOVERY

**Function:** Builds a complete, multi-dimensional understanding of the problem space. This rule encompasses the non-linear navigation of the four directional questions.

**Checks:**
- `What`: The situation, the object, the facts.
- `When`: The timing, the sequence, the deadlines.
- `Where`: The environment, the context, the location.
- `Why`: The initial relevance and purpose.

**Effect:** Generates a clear, holistic picture, creating a solid foundation for a potential action.

---

### Rule 2: VALIDATION / JUSTIFICATION

**Function:** Acts as the critical go/no-go checkpoint. This rule represents the powerful `Why?` Gatekeeper from the V3 model.

**Checks:**
- **Necessity:** Is this action *truly* required?
- **Alignment:** Does it align with the core mission and purpose?
- **Consequence:** Have the second and third-order effects been considered?

**Effect:** Prevents wasted effort on misaligned or unnecessary actions. This is the primary security gate of the entire system.

---

### Rule 3: EXECUTION / METHOD

**Function:** Defines the optimal path for action. This rule only engages *after* the `VALIDATION` gate has been passed.

**Checks:**
- `How`: The most effective and efficient method.
- **Clarity:** Is the plan unambiguous?
- **Resources:** Are the required resources available?

**Effect:** Ensures that validated actions are executed correctly and efficiently.

## V3 → V4 Compression Map

The mapping from V3 to V4 is a compression of phases, not a direct fusion of gates.

| V3 Phase | V3 Function | Mapped to V4 Rule |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Exploration**    | Navigate `What`, `When`, `Where`, `Why` non-linearly | **EXPLORATION / DISCOVERY** |
| **Validation**     | Pass the decisive `Why?` Gatekeeper              | **VALIDATION / JUSTIFICATION**|
| **Execution**      | Define the `How`                                   | **EXECUTION / METHOD**      |

## Visual Comparison

### V3 (Non-Linear Loop)
```
Start with [What, When, Where, Why] → Navigate → Pass [Why?] Gate → Execute (How)
```

### V4 (3 Axioms)
```
EXPLORATION → VALIDATION → EXECUTION
```

## Summary

This updated V4 is a correct axiomatic compression of the true 4Why!!! system. It preserves the essential three-phase structure (Explore, Validate, Execute) while reducing cognitive load.

- **Phase 1 (Exploration):** Understand the landscape.
- **Phase 2 (Validation):** Confirm the journey is necessary.
- **Phase 3 (Execution):** Choose the best path.

It ensures that `How` is never considered before `Why?` has been definitively answered.
